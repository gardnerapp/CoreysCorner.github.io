Hi ! I'm Corey & welcome to my corner of the internet. 
I don't really enjoy the whole superficial nature of social
media and this website is my way of connecting with people 
over the internet. If you don't know me well, I'm Corey 
nice to meet you LOL ! In my free time I train Brazillian 
Jiu Jitsu, do a lot of yoga and meditation, do math, walk 
my dog, and of course lift weights. 

Also I do alot of programming, I started developing apps
with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) & [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). I love developing apps but 
unfortunatly right now I'm pretty much closed for business
because I'm focusing on becoming an ethical hacker.

Ultimatly, my goal is to contribute to the wonderful world
of exploit development and if I work hard enough I hope to 
be able to discover a zero day. Occasionally I also do 
some open source programming, mostly for the [Metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework). 

Ruby is obviously my favorite programming language and I am
slowly but surely trying to write a book on 
Meta-Programming with Ruby. I plan on trying to get it 
published with [NoStarchPress](https://nostarch.com/) because they have some pretty great books. Most programming
books teach you how to code but in the one I'm writing 
we're going to be reading meta programmed code from open source projects like Rails, Devise and of course Metasploit. So stay tuned !

Oh and I occasionally host a podcast with my friends 
called [Coreys Corner](https://open.spotify.com/show/4fkh04PPKFu8U41jBq12FH) . It's basically a podcast about
everything, me and my friends just get together and talk
about all the awesome stuff happening in our lives and 
around the world. Well, thats enough about me anyway thanks
for visiting my small corner of the internet !!
